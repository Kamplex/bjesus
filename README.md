For cool free stuff

Multi-camera projection mapping to 3D environments.

First step; mapping of stationary object (Bogdan's little hat-on-a-cork thingy)
Testing to be done in static environment.
- Four camera's (one for each corner) as well as one camera on the ceiling
Object to be used for mapping
- Little hat thingy

Setup QR-Codes on object for tracking and testing purposes
Tracking environment in 2D for now (3D environment in the future)

Using Node.js, npm and three.js library

Create edge-detection algorithm to scan and recognize objects (possible use for deep-learning algorithms)
In future, use the resulting data to generate a 3D mesh / shape and put this in an environment.

Check out under what license we can/want to release this.

First setup for project
